            <p>
                Ctrl-Mac Simulator as the name suggests, is a visual simulator
                for the Ctrl-Mac protocol, based on the paper by
                <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07492" target="_blank"
                    >Bhatia et. al.</a
                >. <br /><br />
                It has been developed by
                <a href="https://github.com/EdoardoLuciani" target="_blank"
                    >Edoardo Luciani</a
                >
                as part of the dissertation for the graduation year at
                University of Glasgow.
                <br /><br />
                The code is open source and hosted on
                <a
                    href="https://github.com/EdoardoLuciani/ctrl-mac-simulator"
                    target="_blank"
                    >GitHub</a
                >, where contributions are welcome! There you can find
                instructions on how to run the simulation locally, how to access
                the backend api directly, and how to simulate scenarios using
                the command line tool.

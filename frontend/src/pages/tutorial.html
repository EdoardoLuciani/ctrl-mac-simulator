            <h1>How to use the simulator</h1>
            <p>
                In order to generate the simulation, press on the
                <b>Generate Simulation</b> button.
                <img src="/highlight-generate.webp" />

                After waiting a little, you can see the area on the left be
                populated with the network components. In order to start the
                visual simulation
                <b>press the play button</b>, which afterwards can be clicked
                again to pause. The <b>rewind and fast forward</b> buttons can
                be clicked to go <b>back and forth</b> between the cycles.
                <img src="/highlight-controls.webp" />
                <b>Pro Tip: keyboard shortcuts</b> exists for the simulation:
                start/stop can be activated with spacebar, and rewind and fast
                forward with the left and right keyboard arrows.

                <br /><br />
                Additionally by scrolling down, graphs and stats about the
                simulation can be seen. Now try changing the parameters of the
                simulation and see how the visualization and stats changes!

                    <b>Sensor Measurement Chance:</b> Chance that the sensor,
                    when in idle state, senses a real phenomena and wakes up to

            </ul>

            <h2>Stats Explanation</h2>
            <p>
            <h4>FTR Line Chart</h4>
                The FTR value represents the current number of sensors that are
                backed off. A high FTR value means that there is high network
                congestion and many sensors are currently awaiting their turn. A
                low FTR value means that a small number of sensor is
                awaiting their turn and the network is not busy. From the line
                chart, it can be seen how the FTR evolves as time goes on.
                <img src="/ftr-value-graph.webp" />
                <br />
                As an example the above graph has been generated for a high
                congested network scenario (50 sensors with 6 slots). The FTR
                value in the graph ramps up quick, and settles around 19. This
                means that the FTR equilibrium value is around 19.

                <br /><br />
                <h4>Measurement Latency Distribution</h4>
                The histogram on the right instead represents the distribution
                of data transmission latencies. The latency in this case is
                referred as the difference in time between when the data
                transmission has been received by the gateway and by when the
                data was first sensed.
                <img src="/latency-histogram-graph.webp" />
                As noted by the histogram (generated with the same 50 sensors
                and 6 slots scenario), most of the messages arrive quick,
                however there are a few outliers that are caused by the same
                sensor getting incresedly backed off.
